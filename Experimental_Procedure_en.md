# Experimental Procedure for the Study of the Effect of Drug X on T Cell Activity in Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs)

## Experiment Title
The Effect of Research Drug X on T Cell Activity in Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs)

## Experimental Purpose
Evaluate whether drug X can enhance or inhibit the activity of T cells.

## Experimental Materials
- Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
- Drug X
- Negative control (DMSO or saline)
- Positive control (e.g., PHA or ConA)
- T cell activation marker antibodies (such as CD69, CD25)
- Flow cytometer
- Cell culture media and related reagents

## Experimental Steps
1. **Cell preparation**: Separate PBMCs from the blood of healthy volunteers.
2. **Grouping**:
   - Control group: add culture medium only.
   - Negative control group: add an equal volume of DMSO or saline.
   - Positive control group: add known T cell activators (such as PHA or ConA).
   - Experimental group: add different concentrations of drug X.
3. **Cell culture**: Place each group of cells in a 37â„ƒ, 5% CO2 incubator for 48 hours.
4. **Cell staining**: After the culture, collect the cells and use T cell activation marker antibody for surface staining.
5. **Flow analysis**: Use a flow cytometer to detect the expression of T cell surface markers in each group.

Data analysis
- Compare the expression levels of T cell surface markers in each group.
- Use statistical software to analyze the data and determine whether the effect of drug X on T cell activity is statistically significant.

## Precautions
- Ensure that all operations are carried out under sterile conditions.
- The experiment should be repeated at least three times to ensure the reliability of the results.
- Record all experimental conditions and results for further analysis.
